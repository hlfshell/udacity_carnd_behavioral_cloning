Overview
---
This is the third project in term 1 of the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree. This project has me recording my performance on the included simulator, feeding this to the designed network, and then seeing if the network has learned to copy my driving behavior.

Included are the following files:
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* WRITEUP.md a report writeup file (either markdown or pdf)
* run1.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)
